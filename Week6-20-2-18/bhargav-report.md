Converted the required data into Mathematical form.
Trained classifiers on Number of assignees, Number of comments and the Author Association to predict the closing time
The Classifiers trained are : 
  1)KNN(For n_neighbors = 1 to n_neighbors = 31, 10 FOLD CROSS VALIDATION)
  2)Decision trees(With max_depths 1 to 5)
  3)Random Forest Classifier
  4)Logistic Regression
  5)
